Addon Compatibility Scripts for CABIN
These are for mods that are not installed by default, sections of this script will enable if the applicable mod is installed.
With how many create addons there are, it would not be feasible for me to add compat for them all.
If you have a create addon that you think could fit in the general theme/tone/whathaveyou of CABIN, make a PR with it.

if (Platform.isLoaded('YourModID')) { // Mod ID goes here
	ServerEvents.recipes(event => {
		// Here's a machine recipe example. The code for these functions are defined in _helper.js
		// Note that machine recipes will remove all default recipes for the output item
		(material)Machine(event,Item.of('minecraft:dirt', 1)) // Recipes without an additional item will be stonecutting (saw) recipes
		(material)Machine(event,Item.of('minecraft:dispenser', 2), 'minecraft:bow')  // Recipes with one are smithing table recipes

		//Valid machines are andesite, copper, gold, brass, zinc, invar, enderium, and fluix
		//You can also use createMachine() to create a machine recipe using an item other then the normal machine items
		//This code will create a machine crafting recipe for an enchanting table using a "diamond block" machine with a book as the second materal
		createMachine('minecraft:diamond_block', event, 'minecraft:enchanting_table', 'minecraft:book')

		// Shapeless recipe example
		event.shapeless("create:creative_crate", ["minecraft:redstone_ore", "minecraft:lapis_ore"])
		// Please refer to the kubejs wiki for other recipe types
		// https://wiki.latvian.dev/books/kubejs/page/recipes
