Mods Scripts for CABIN
These are mods that are installed in the pack by default but aren't necessary for beating the modpack.
Some people may want to remove a mod from here in favour of adding a mod from the compatability scripts or an entirely different mod.
Be aware that some of the side content quests may not work after a mod is removed. The main quest line will remain in tact though.
